Manage SSL/TLS encryption so connections use https:// instead of http://.
explian.



# HTTP vs HTTPS

    http:// = HyperText Transfer Protocol. Plain text, not secure.

    https:// = HTTP Secure. Same protocol, but encrypted with SSL/TLS.

# SSL

    Secure Sockets Layer.

    An old protocol (from Netscape, 1995) to secure connections.

    Versions: SSLv2 (1995), SSLv3 (1996). Both now obsolete.

# TLS

    Transport Layer Security.

    Modern replacement for SSL (introduced in 1999).

    Provides:

        üîí Encryption (no one can read your data)

        üÜî Authentication (server proves its identity)

        üõ° Integrity (data not modified in transit)

# Certificates

    A certificate is like a digital ID card for your server.

    In Inception, you‚Äôll create a self-signed certificate with openssl.

    Browsers will warn ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è not trusted,‚Äù but that‚Äôs okay for the project.

# Port 80 vs Port 443

    Port 80 = HTTP (insecure). Forbidden in Inception.

    Port 443 = HTTPS (secure). Must be the only entry.
# @Task must manage SSL/TLS encryption.
    @Task Your NGINX container must be the only entry point, listening only on port 443 (the HTTPS port).

    @Task You must use TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.

    @Task Access via http://login.42.fr must fail, and only https://login.42.fr should work

    @Task: Subject = requires HTTPS with TLS.
    You must set up NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only


üìå In short
    Yes, you must configure HTTPS with SSL/TLS in Inception.
    HTTP access (:80) must be blocked.
    You generate a self-signed TLS certificate with OpenSSL inside the NGINX container.
    NGINX is configured to use listen 443 ssl; with your .crt and .key files.
    During defense, evaluator will check:
        http://login.42.fr ‚Üí ‚ùå blocked
        https://login.42.fr ‚Üí ‚úÖ loads WordPress site


#  .gitignore and secrets:

    Don‚Äôt commit real credentials; keep examples like .env.example with placeholders, and ignore the real .env. The subject explicitly warns about credentials in git.

## Dockerfile
	RUN openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 \
    -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key \
    -out /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt \
    -subj "/C=DE/ST=BE/L=Berlin/O=42/OU=Inception/CN=localhost"
	
 Each part means:
     openssl ‚Üí the main tool for cryptography.
    req ‚Üí request a certificate.
    -x509 ‚Üí create a self-signed certificate (not a certificate request for a CA).
    -nodes ‚Üí ‚Äúno DES‚Äù: don‚Äôt encrypt the private key with a password (needed for automation).
    -out <file> ‚Üí where to save the certificate file (.crt).
    -keyout <file> ‚Üí where to save the private key (.key).
    -subj ‚Üí pre-fill subject fields (so Docker doesn‚Äôt hang asking questions).

    -subj "/C=FR/ST=IDF/L=Paris/O=42/OU=42/CN=login.42.fr":
        C=FR ‚Üí Country = France
            ST=IDF ‚Üí State = √éle-de-France
                L=Paris ‚Üí Locality = Paris
                O=42 ‚Üí Organization = 42
                    OU=42 ‚Üí Organizational Unit = 42
        CN=login.42.fr ‚Üí Common Name = your domain (e.g., akurmyza.42.fr)
