@Task: Subject = requires HTTPS with TLS.
📌 What the subject says

You must set up NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only



Manage SSL/TLS encryption so connections use https:// instead of http://.
explian.

Yes ✅ — in Inception you must manage SSL/TLS encryption.
The subject explicitly says:

    Your NGINX container must be the only entry point, listening only on port 443 (the HTTPS port).

    You must use TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.

    Access via http://login.42.fr must fail, and only https://login.42.fr should work

    .

🔑 What the terms mean

HTTP vs HTTPS

    http:// = HyperText Transfer Protocol. Plain text, not secure.

    https:// = HTTP Secure. Same protocol, but encrypted with SSL/TLS.

SSL

    Secure Sockets Layer.

    An old protocol (from Netscape, 1995) to secure connections.

    Versions: SSLv2 (1995), SSLv3 (1996). Both now obsolete.

TLS

    Transport Layer Security.

    Modern replacement for SSL (introduced in 1999).

    Provides:

        🔒 Encryption (no one can read your data)

        🆔 Authentication (server proves its identity)

        🛡 Integrity (data not modified in transit)

Certificates

    A certificate is like a digital ID card for your server.

    In Inception, you’ll create a self-signed certificate with openssl.

    Browsers will warn “⚠️ not trusted,” but that’s okay for the project.

Port 80 vs Port 443

    Port 80 = HTTP (insecure). Forbidden in Inception.

    Port 443 = HTTPS (secure). Must be the only entry.

🔤 Breaking down important command flags

When you generate a certificate in your NGINX Dockerfile, you’ll see a command like:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -out /etc/nginx/ssl/inception.crt \
            -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/inception.key \
            -subj "/C=FR/ST=IDF/L=Paris/O=42/OU=42/CN=login.42.fr"

Each part means:

    openssl → the main tool for cryptography.

    req → request a certificate.

    -x509 → create a self-signed certificate (not a certificate request for a CA).

    -nodes → “no DES”: don’t encrypt the private key with a password (needed for automation).

    -out <file> → where to save the certificate file (.crt).

    -keyout <file> → where to save the private key (.key).

    -subj → pre-fill subject fields (so Docker doesn’t hang asking questions).

Inside -subj "/C=FR/ST=IDF/L=Paris/O=42/OU=42/CN=login.42.fr":

    C=FR → Country = France

    ST=IDF → State = Île-de-France

    L=Paris → Locality = Paris

    O=42 → Organization = 42

    OU=42 → Organizational Unit = 42

    CN=login.42.fr → Common Name = your domain (e.g., akurmyza.42.fr)

📌 In short

    Yes, you must configure HTTPS with SSL/TLS in Inception.

    HTTP access (:80) must be blocked.

    You generate a self-signed TLS certificate with OpenSSL inside the NGINX container.

    NGINX is configured to use listen 443 ssl; with your .crt and .key files.

    During defense, evaluator will check:

        http://login.42.fr → ❌ blocked

        https://login.42.fr → ✅ loads WordPress site

👉 Do you want me to write out the step-by-step NGINX + SSL setup (with exact config and Dockerfile lines) the way the subject expects, explained line by line?
You said:
i write notes. schould i put it to nginx or separate?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: keep your notes separate (in the repo), and only put short, practical comments inside nginx.conf and the NGINX Dockerfile.

Why:

    The subject/eval only requires config files in srcs/ and a Makefile at the root — it doesn’t ask you to bake notes into images. Keeping notes outside the image is cleaner and avoids shipping docs inside containers.

    You must not commit secrets; separating notes helps you avoid accidentally mixing credentials with configs.

What I recommend:

    Repo structure (docs separate):

/Makefile
/srcs/
  docker-compose.yml
  .env              # not committed or templated; keep real secrets out of git
  /requirements/
    /nginx/
      Dockerfile
      /conf/nginx.conf
    /wordpress/...
    /mariadb/...
/docs/
  INCEPTION_NOTES.md
  TLS.md
  NGINX.md

    Put all long explanations, step lists, and references in /docs/*.md.

    Add a short “How to run” section in the root README.md that links to /docs/.

    Inline comments (only what helps the grader):

    In nginx.conf: brief comments explaining the TLS lines, why listen 443 ssl; and ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; are set, and how PHP requests are proxied to wordpress:9000.

    In Dockerfile: tiny comments for each RUN (e.g., why -y, what the openssl req -x509 -nodes ... flags mean).

    Keep them short so configs stay readable during the defense (the evaluator will open these files).

    .gitignore and secrets:

    Don’t commit real credentials; keep examples like .env.example with placeholders, and ignore the real .env. The subject explicitly warns about credentials in git.
