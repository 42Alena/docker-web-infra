What is systemctl?

It’s a command-line tool used to control the systemd system manager.

systemd is like the “brain” that manages background programs (services/daemons) on modern Linux systems.

Think of it as a remote control for starting, stopping, and checking services.

systemctl [action] [service]

Common actions:

    start → start a service now

    stop → stop a service now

    restart → stop and start again

    status → show whether a service is running

    enable → make the service auto-start when VM boots

    disable → prevent service from auto-starting

🔹 Examples (with Docker)

When you install Docker in your VM, you’ll manage it with systemctl:
sudo systemctl start docker

Starts the Docker service (daemon).
sudo systemctl enable docker

Ensures Docker will always start when the VM boots.
sudo systemctl status docker

Shows logs + whether Docker is running or not.
sudo systemctl stop docker

Why you need it for Inception

After installing Docker, the service must be running in the background; otherwise docker commands won’t work.

That’s why you’ll run:

sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
