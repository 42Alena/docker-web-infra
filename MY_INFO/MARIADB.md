#  IF not created folder yet =>  create the data folders on your host:
(In the school VM you‚Äôll switch to /home/<login>/data/... ‚Äî but on macOS, /Users/... is correct.)

`mkdir -p ~/data/mariadb`

`mkdir -p ~/data/wordpress`

On macOS, this expands to /Users/alenakurmyza/data/....
in Docker compose:
```
	volumes:
	...   

	device: /Users/alenakurmyza/data/mariadb   #  real path on your Mac`
```
### Then rebuild and run again
```
docker compose down -v                # clean old containers + volumes
docker compose up -d mariadb
```



# Dockerfile
```
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests \
    mariadb-server && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
- Installs only MariaDB server.

- -y ‚Üí auto-confirm yes.

- --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests ‚Üí prevents installing extra unnecessary packages ‚Üí smaller image.

- rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* ‚Üí cleans package cache, best practice for smaller images.

# Port  MDB internal = 3306
`EXPOSE 3306 ` 

Documents the DB port.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: in docker-compose.yml, use expose: "3306" (internal only), not ports: "3306:3306" ‚Äî only WordPress should reach MariaDB, not the host.


#  give MariaDB my custom config.
```
COPY conf/50-server.cnf /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
```
- conf/50-server.cnf = my custom MariaDB configuration file (I keep it in my repo under srcs/requirements/mariadb/conf/).

- Destination path = /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf inside the container.

- When MariaDB starts, it loads all config files from /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/.

- By copying my file here, I override default config (port, bind address, data directory, etc.).
```
[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
bind-address=0.0.0.0    # allow connections from wordpress container
port=3306
```
# initializes DB and users on first start.
```
# Copy own  init script
COPY tools/init_db.sh /init_db.sh
RUN chmod +x /init_db.sh

...
ENTRYPOINT [ "/init_db.sh" ]
```
In official MariaDB/MySQL Docker Hub images, there is a special folder:

`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`
‚Üí Scripts placed there run automatically when the container starts.

But in Inception  not allowed to use official images
 Why  init_db.sh  is neded?  
- Subject requires that my database and users are created via environment variables, not hardcoded

# Run MDB server in foreground (not background)           
`CMD ["mysqld_safe"]     `

https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-safe 

- mysqld_safe is a wrapper script provided by MySQL/MariaDB.
- Its job is to start the real MariaDB server process (mysqld) in a safe way.
Starts mysqld (the database daemon).
- compare to CMD ["mysqld"] simpler, CMD ["mysqld_safe"] gives you automatic restart and logging.

That‚Äôs the real program that listens on port 3306 and handles SQL queries.

Adds safety features:

- Restarts mysqld automatically if it crashes.

- Logs errors to the MariaDB log file.

- Sets some useful defaults.

- Runs in foreground (so Docker sees it as PID 1).

Why it‚Äôs good in Docker

- In Docker, the main process (PID 1) must run in foreground.

- If PID 1 exits ‚Üí container stops.

- Subject forbids hacks like tail -f /dev/null or sleep infinity

mysqld_safe is the safe wrapper around the MariaDB server process. It starts the real mysqld daemon, restarts it if it crashes, and writes errors to logs. In Docker, it runs in the foreground as PID 1, so the container stays alive without hacks like tail -f, which are forbidden by the subject.

# TEST!
Perfect üëç ‚Äî I‚Äôll make you a **full exam-style test table** for MariaDB, including:

* All useful `docker` and `docker compose` commands
* All database checks
* What the evaluator will expect (based on eval sheet).

## ‚úÖ What evaluators check specifically (from eval sheet)

* There is a **Dockerfile for MariaDB**.
* Container **starts without crash**.
* There is a **dedicated volume** bound to `/home/<login>/data/mariadb`.
* Student can **log into DB** (`mysql -u root -p`).
* The database is **not empty** (must show your `${SQL_DATABASE}`).
* User creation & privileges work (`${SQL_USER}`).
* Data is **persistent after reboot**.

---
---

# üöÄ Real MariaDB Setup (from scratch)

### Step 1 ‚Äî Open a shell inside container

üîë So we can run commands manually (like evaluator might ask you).

```bash
docker exec -it mariadb bash
```

Now you are inside the container.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äî Connect to MariaDB as root

üîë You must be able to log in as root (using password from `.env`).

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

* `-u root` = login with user root.
* `-p` = prompt for password (type the `$DB_ROOT_PASS` from `.env`).

‚úÖ If login works, you see:

```
MariaDB [(none)]>
```

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Show existing databases

üîë Confirm system tables exist.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

‚úÖ You should see:

```
information_schema
mysql
performance_schema
sys
```

(+ maybe `wordpress` if you already created it).

---

### Step 4 ‚Äî Create your project database

üîë Subject requires: **a dedicated WordPress DB**.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
```

‚úÖ Check:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

‚Üí Now includes `wordpress`.

---

### Step 5 ‚Äî Create a WordPress user

üîë Subject requires: **a non-root user** with password, for WordPress.

```sql
CREATE USER 'wpuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'wppass';
```

* `'wpuser'` = your `$DB_USER`.
* `'%'` = can connect from any host (important, since WP runs in a different container).
* `'wppass'` = your `$DB_PASS`.

‚úÖ Check:

```sql
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```

‚Üí Should list `wpuser` with Host `%`.

---

### Step 6 ‚Äî Grant privileges

üîë WordPress needs full rights on its DB.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

* `wordpress.*` = all tables inside `wordpress` DB.
* `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` = apply changes immediately.

‚úÖ Check:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'wpuser'@'%';
```

‚Üí Should show `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.*`.

---

### Step 7 ‚Äî Test the new user

Exit root session:

```sql
exit;
```

Reconnect as the new user:

```bash
mysql -u wpuser -p wppass wordpress
```

‚úÖ If it connects and prompt shows:

```
MariaDB [wordpress]>
```

‚Üí User works and has access.

---

# ‚úÖ Summary (what subject requires you to prove)

1. **Root login works** (with env password).
2. **Your DB exists** (e.g., `wordpress`).
3. **Custom user exists** (not root).
4. **User has privileges only on that DB**.
5. **Persistence**: if you restart container, DB and user are still there.

---

# ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${DB_ROOT_PASS}';

 ALTER USER = SQL command to change an existing user account. Here we‚Äôre modifying the root account.


 ----------
 ## DB_HOST=mariadb:3306
 nside Docker Compose, each service name (mariadb, wordpress, nginx) becomes a DNS hostname on the custom network (here: inception).
That‚Äôs why WordPress can reach MariaDB simply by calling host mariadb.

MariaDB listens on port 3306 (default). So the connection string is:
mariadb:3306


    ‚Üí host = service name mariadb
    ‚Üí port = 3306

This is needed because if you just set DB_HOST=localhost, WordPress inside its container would try to connect to itself, not the MariaDB container.
