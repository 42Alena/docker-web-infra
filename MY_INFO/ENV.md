Put all secrets in srcs/.env

real .env put in .gitignore=> never push original passw to git

# in   docker-compose.yml for each service:

```bash
env_file: ./srcs/.env
```

Docker Compose will automatically read and inject all variables from that file into the container environments. You donâ€™t need to repeat them with environment: unless you want to override or limit which ones are passed.

Tip

Don't use environment variables to pass sensitive information, such as passwords, in to your containers. Use secrets instead.
